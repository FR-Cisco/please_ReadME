Hello to whomever this may concern,

My name is Francisco Ruiz and these are many of the projects I have written since April 2016.

Space Invaders (April 2016): This is my very first major coding project where I attempted to 
                replicate the classic arcade game that I fell in love with as a child. There 
                is a jar file within this repo so feel free to try it for yourself! The code 
                highlights many self-taught concepts regarding multi-threading, event handling, 
                collision detection, etc.

LinkedIn Web Scraper (August 2018): During an internship at Chatdesk I was asked to scrape key
                information on many many many customer service and related companys in both the
                US and Canada. Ultimately I exported that to CSV. The resulting script underwent
                many revisions as LinkeIn's API is notoriously limiting. I utilized Beautiful Soup,
                the REST API, and other libraries to create a "browser" persay and log in to LinkedIn
                remotely. For safety reasons I have removed much of the sensitive information in this.
                I have also built a localized version of my work that simply scrapes saved html webpages.
